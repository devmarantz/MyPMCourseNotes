# Module 1 - Learning Outcomes

## Goals of Module
  - Describe the four stages of a project.
  - List the key tools used in a typical IT project.
  - Explain the function of a Gantt chart.
  - Identify the five main elements of a PERT diagram and what purpose they serve.
  - Illustrate how a Critical Path is developed.
  - Discuss the impact of failing to plan a project.

---
## Project Management Includes
  - Organizing people, resources, and procedures
  - Accomplishing a project within a set timeline and budget
  - When starting think about
    - Purpose and aim of project
    - Your resources available
    - Costs, human constraints, and time
    - The tasks and procedures to complete the project

### Tools
Used for documenting and tracking the progress of a project
  - GANTT Charts
  - Critical Path Method (CPM)
  - Program Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT)

## PM Methodology
### Phases
  1. Investigation
  2. Planning and Design 
  3. Production
  4. Monitoring and Evaluation

### Phase 1 - Investigation
  - Involves:
    - The initial commissioning of the project
    - The identification of the initial aim and goals
    - Studying the possible ways the project could be completed
  - Is undertaken by top level management or strategic planners

### Phase 2 - Planning & Design 
#### Important because
  - Provides foundation for the project
  - Ensures objectives can be met within the budget and timeline
#### Involves
  - Defining the
    - Purpose of the project
    - Objectives to be achieved

  - Breaking the project into tasks or activities
    - Defining the purpose of each one

  - Estimating the time required for each activity
    - shortest and longest possible 

  - Identifying milestones and key time markers
    - keeps the project on schedule

  - Determining the sequence of activities and any constraints affecting the sequence. 
    - Critical Path!
    - For example, some tasks must be completed before other ones can start, or particular resources might be required for the activity. 

    - This also includes:
      - Deciding which activities should be completed before others can commence
      - Identifying activities that can be done simultaneously or must be done at the same time
      - Assigning resources, people, materials and equipment to activities
      - Estimating the cost of resources
      - Drawing up a calendar of events

#### Tools for Planning & Design 
  - A project plan for management review
  - A GANTT chart
  - A PERT diagram, including a critical path, or a network diagra

### Phase 3 - Production 
#### Involves
  - Providing the resources
  - Completing the activities
  - Monitoring, controlling and recording the progress of the project on the GANTT chart
  - Comparing the current progress to the planned schedule
  - Updating and refining the schedule as required
  - Monitoring resource use to ensure no budgetary blowout
  - Ensuring milestones and overall goals are met

### Phase 4 - Monitoring and Evaluation
- Once the project is transferred to the client the project team is 'decommissioned'
- Management will assess the success of a project
  - How effecient and effective was everything?
#### Success Assessment
  - Quality
    - How well it has met the objectives? 
    - What is the final quality of the product?
  - Cost
    - Did the project stay within the budget specified and proposed use of resources?
  - Time
    - Did the project finish on or before the specified date? 
    - Was it the shortest possible time for the project?
  - Timeliness
    - Was the project completed in time for the information to be of use?
  - Accuracy
    - Are there any errors in the product?
  - Relevance
    - Does the project/product include only those elements required by the client?
  - Completeness
    - Does the client have everything they need in order to do their work and make their decisions?
