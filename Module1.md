  - When starting think about
    - Purpose and aim of project
    - Your resources available
    - Costs, human constraints, and time
    - The tasks and procedures to complete the project

### Tools
Used for documenting and tracking the progress of a project
  - GANTT Charts

  - Program Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT)

## PM Methodology
### Phases
  1. Investigation
  2. Planning and Design 
  3. Production
  4. Monitoring and Evaluation

### Phase 1 - Investigation
  - Involves:
    - The initial commissioning of the project
    - The identification of the initial aim and goals
    - Studying the possible ways the project could be completed
  - Is undertaken by top level management or strategic planners

### Phase 2 - Planning & Design 
#### Important because
  - Provides foundation for the project
  - Ensures objectives can be met within the budget and timeline
#### Involves
  - Defining the
    - Purpose of the project
    - Objectives to be achieved

  - Breaking the project into tasks or activities
    - Defining the purpose of each one

  - Estimating the time required for each activity
    - shortest and longest possible 

  - Identifying milestones and key time markers
    - keeps the project on schedule

  - Determining the sequence of activities and any constraints affecting the sequence. 
    - Critical Path!
    - For example, some tasks must be completed before other ones can start, or particular resources might be required for the activity. 

    - This also includes:
      - Deciding which activities should be completed before others can commence
      - Identifying activities that can be done simultaneously or must be done at the same time
      - Assigning resources, people, materials and equipment to activities
      - Estimating the cost of resources
      - Drawing up a calendar of events

#### Tools for Planning & Design 
  - A project plan for management review
  - A GANTT chart
  - A PERT diagram, including a critical path, or a network diagra

### Phase 3 - Production 
#### Involves
  - Providing the resources
  - Completing the activities
  - Monitoring, controlling and recording the progress of the project on the GANTT chart
  - Comparing the current progress to the planned schedule
  - Updating and refining the schedule as required
  - Monitoring resource use to ensure no budgetary blowout
  - Ensuring milestones and overall goals are met

### Phase 4 - Monitoring and Evaluation
- Once the project is transferred to the client the project team is 'decommissioned'
- Management will assess the success of a project
  - How effecient and effective was everything?
#### Success Assessment
  - Quality
    - How well it has met the objectives? 
    - What is the final quality of the product?
  - Cost
    - Did the project stay within the budget specified and proposed use of resources?
  - Time
    - Did the project finish on or before the specified date? 
    - Was it the shortest possible time for the project?
  - Timeliness
    - Was the project completed in time for the information to be of use?
  - Accuracy
    - Are there any errors in the product?
  - Relevance
    - Does the project/product include only those elements required by the client?
  - Completeness
    - Does the client have everything they need in order to do their work and make their decisions?

### Phase 5 - Case Study
#### Interview Tips
  - Show your understanding of the position
  - Highlight your pertinent skills

### Phase 6 - PM Tools
  - PM Tools are generally used for:
    1. Estimating Activity Time
        - Based off of experience or 
    2. Scheduling and Expediting 
        - If there are delays they should identify alternate actions to bring the project back within the time constraints. 
          - This is done by putting more resources, time or money into a particular activity. 
        - Assessing time and costs need to be traded off in order to get the project completed.
        - Expediting the schedule involves identifying tasks that could possibly be reduced in time if enough money or resources were available.
    3. Critical Path Method
      ![Critical Path](./images/1.6-critical.png)
        - A series of activities which are vital to the event being completed on time
        - A delay in one event will delay the completion of the project.

#### GANTT Charts
  ![GANTT Chart](./images/1.6-GANTT.png)
  - Displays tasks and costs along a horizontal time scale
  - Each tasks is recorded accoring to it's start and end date
  - Shows the best possible way to complete a project in the shortest time
  - Activities can be sequential or in parallel
  - Note
    - Does not show critical path
    - Does not show relationships between tasks

#### PERT Diagrams
  ![PERT Chart](./images/1.6-PERT.png)

  - Show relationships between activities and time frames
  - Better at identifying the relationship between tasks rather than the progress of tasks over time.

  - Key Elements in PERT Diagrams
    1. Activities
        - list of activities in the project and their dependencies
    2. Nodes/Events
        - indicating the beginning or end of an activity
    3. Network lines 
        - show the interdependence of events
    4. Critical path
        - the sequence of dependent events that have the sum of longest duration
    5. Slack time
        - events not on the critical path usually have slack time
        -  extra time for that event that does not effect the timing of other events thus not effecting the project time. That means that can fall behind schedule and there is no impact on the project completion date.
